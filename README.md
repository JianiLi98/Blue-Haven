# Blue Haven

**Blue Haven** is a 2D platformer jump adventure built with Godot.  
It experiments with **movement mechanics, visual perception, and playful transformations**, offering players a unique blend of precision, challenge, and atmosphere. 

It is a story of a sad blue slime who cannot find a buddy of the same colour on land and feels lonely. But through adventure, the slime finds the ocean ---- home and blue haven. The slime is actually a drop of water. We want to express that the world is infinitely large and inviting. 
We should not despair in the face of estrangement and believe that we can always find a sense of belonging through patience and endurance.
